#### Predictive Control Solution for Advanced Fenestration and Integrated Energy Systems
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## General
This package was developed to host a suite of control algorithms developed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's [Windows Group](https://windows.lbl.gov/). Most controls asre based on [Model Predictive Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_predictive_control). This framework utilizes the Distributed Optimal Energy Resources [DOPER](https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/DOPER) to implement the algorithms.

*Please note that the AFC package and especially the examples are still under development. Please open an issue for specific questions*

## Getting Started
The following link permits users to clone the source directory containing the [AFC](https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/AFC) package.

The package depends on external modules which can be installed from pypi with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

TBD

## Example
To illustrate and test its functionality, each module executes some tests, when called as `main`.

Example Jupyter notebooks can be found [here](https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/AFC/tree/master/examples) where a full controller stack, with different time constants, is illustrated.
