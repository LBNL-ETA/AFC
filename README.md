#### Predictive Control Solution for Advanced Fenestration and Integrated Energy Systems
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## General
This publicly available control package was developed to allow easy access to integrated dynamic facade and smart building control algorithms developed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's (LBNL) [Windows Group](https://windows.lbl.gov/). Dynamic facades can be any automated facade product such as motorized blinds, shades, or electrochromic windows. The control algorithms are based on the [Model Predictive Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_predictive_control) technique and utilize LBNLâ€™s Distributed Optimal Energy Resources ([DOPER](https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/DOPER)) and Framework for Multi-Layer Control ([FMLC](https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/FMLC)) developments to implement the algorithms.


A general overview of integrated dynamic facade and smart building controls can be found in the [Smart Buildings Breakthrough Technology](https://windows.lbl.gov/news/smart-buildings-breakthrough) news article.

The Advanced Fenestration Controller (AFC) is designed to minimize electricity cost and/or emissions in buildings through the control of dynamic facades (for example electrochromic windows, blinds, and shades), and lighting and HVAC systems. The AFC also considers a variety of control parameters such as visual and thermal comfort (glare, daylight, view, health, and wellness). It uses weather forecasts, and a set of measurements (room and floor temperature) to optimize control setpoints over a specified time horizon of typically 24 hours. The functionality illustrated below:

*Please note that the AFC package and especially the examples are still under development. Please open an issue for specific questions.*

## Getting Started
The following link permits users to clone the source directory containing the [AFC](https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/AFC) package and then locally install with the `pip install .` command.

Alternatively, AFC can be directly installed with `pip install git+https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/AFC`.

## Example
To test the installation and illustrate the functionality of AFC, the following command can be executed to run the [example_1.py](https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/AFC/blob/master/examples/example_1.py).

```python
python examples/example_1.py
```

The output should be:

```
